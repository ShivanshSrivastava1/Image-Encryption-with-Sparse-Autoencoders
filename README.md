# Image Encryption with Sparse Autoencoders

### Team Members
Howard Yong (hy2724) and Shivansh Srivastava (ss5945)

### Description
Final project for COMS W4995: Deep Learning for Computer Vision with Prof. Peter Belhumeur from the Fall 2022 semester at Columbia University (https://www.deeplearningforcomputervision.com/). Contains all notebooks and source, data, and model files.

### Instructions
First, ensure that you have access to the data and weights folders. You can access the data folder here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JYgueK5dOL7rwXsOQXG9cyZylxr_IdtP?usp=sharing. You can access the weights folder here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qjMcHMet4ynuvjTE_hQEO2YmcfYZHqls?usp=sharing. Both of these are large files, so they may be downloaded as zip files. Also, ensure that you have access to the unzipped version of the outputs folder. (The zipped version of the outputs folder is included in this repository.) You must have access to the unzipped versions of all 3 of these folders in order to run the notebooks.

After obtaining the unzipped folders, open training.ipynb. If using Google Colab, replace the first 2 cells with the appropriate paths for your file locations in your Drive. If running locally, ignore the first 2 cells and run every cell from the 3rd cell onwards. Please note that it is highly recommended to use a GPU when working with these models.

Upon successfully executing all cells in training.ipynb, open testing.ipynb. If using Google Colab, replace the first 2 cells with the appropriate paths in your Drive. If running locally, ignore the first 2 cells and run every cell from the 3rd cell onwards. Again, it is highly recommended to use a GPU.
