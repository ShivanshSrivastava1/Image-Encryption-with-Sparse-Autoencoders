# Image Encryption with Sparse Autoencoders

### Team Members
Howard Yong (hy2724) and Shivansh Srivastava (ss5945)

### Description
Final project for COMS W4995: Deep Learning for Computer Vision with Prof. Peter Belhumeur from the Fall 2022 semester at Columbia University (https://www.deeplearningforcomputervision.com/). Contains all notebooks and source, data, and model files.

### Instructions
Begin by opening training.ipynb. If using Google Colab, replace the first 2 cells with the appropriate paths for your file locations in your Drive. If running locally, ignore the first 2 cells and run every cell from the 3rd cell onwards. Please note that it is highly recommended to use a GPU when working with these models.

Upon successfully executing all cells in training.ipynb, open testing.ipynb. If using Google Colab, replace the first 2 cells with the appropriate paths in your Drive. If running locally, ignore the first 2 cells and run every cell from the 3rd cell onwards. Again, it is highly recommended to use a GPU.
